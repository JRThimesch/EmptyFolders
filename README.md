# EmptyFolders

## Usage 
Due to my own laziness, I've made this script to help facilitate the testing of other scripts. Maybe it has some purpose to you, maybe it doesn't, but it's fairly versatile.

## Flags
All flags have some level of explanation through the --help/-h flag, but further explanation and examples are provided below.

***-o or --onlyFile*** :: This flag can be used if you would like to remove only certain file extensions from the directory. 
Adding `-o .txt` to the arguments of the script will only remove files that end with .txt, furthermore `-o .txt .mp3 .mp4` will remove .txt, .mp3, and .mp4 files. *If this flag is not set, the script will remove all files it encounters.*
